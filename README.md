 - Third: It will appear in your repositories section where you can clone it with the command:
  (If using linux): sudo git clone https://github.com/lausuarez02/testMeep.git 
  or just git clone where you want the files. I reccomend to create a folder and go inside it and clone the respositorie there.
 - Fourth: Go inside the app and do a npm install just in case and the run npm start, then you would be able to see it in localhost:3000
